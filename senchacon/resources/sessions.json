While fighting here and there with plain PHP, HTML, JavaScript and CSS, his development experience took a major leap forward in 2007 when he started to work with two of today’s still leading web frameworks: Ruby on Rails and Ext JS. Since then he's enjoying Ruby and JavaScript on a daily basis. He has been working on numerous projects involving Ext JS and Sencha Touch. Steffen is working preferably close to the beach such as in Spain and Aruba, where he also tries to kitesurf as much as possible.",

        "description": "Sencha Ext JS has always been a pioneer in widget libraries creating visual attractive interfaces out of the box allowing the creation of highly interactive single page applications. Not only did Sencha enhance the framework’s look throughout the years, but it also introduced powerful features to allow developers to customize the look and feel in an efficient way. One big step forward was the migration to Sass with Compass for styling which improved the code organization of CSS code immensely. Later the introduction of packages added support for easily adding custom themes that enhance an application’s style and components.\n\nIn 2014, Google announced Material design, a comprehensive guide for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices. Ever since, it has received praise by developers and designers. In this session, we’ll explore how to build a Material design interface on top of the most powerful enterprise JavaScript framework of today by leveraging its powerful customization features. We'll look into what makes a Material design interface, how to create a custom theme package, how to create custom components, how to create custom animations, how to make the same application mouse and touch friendly and how to make the interface responsive to desktop and tablet screens.",

Since then he's enjoying Ruby and JavaScript on a daily basis. He has been working on numerous projects involving Ext JS and Sencha Touch.
